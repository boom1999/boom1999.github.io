$LaTeX$ (/ˈlɑːtɛx/ LAH-tekh or /ˈleɪtɛx/ LAY-tekh, often stylized as LATEX) is a **software system** for document preparation. When writing, the writer uses plain text as opposed to the formatted text found in WYSIWYG word processors like Microsoft Word, LibreOffice Writer and Apple Pages. The writer uses **markup tagging conventions** to define the general structure of a document to stylise text throughout a document (such as bold and italics), and to add citations and cross-references. A TeX distribution such as TeX Live or MiKTeX is used to produce an output file (such as PDF or DVI) suitable for printing or digital distribution.

## Introduction

- $ LaTeX $ is widely used in **academia** for the communication and publication of scientific documents in many fields, including **mathematics, computer science, engineering, physics, chemistry, economics, linguistics, quantitative psychology, philosophy, and political science**. It also has a prominent role in the preparation and publication of books and articles that contain complex multilingual materials, such as Arabic and Greek. LaTeX uses the TeX typesetting program for formatting its output, and is itself written in the **$TeX$ macro language**.

- $ LaTeX $ can be used as **a standalone document preparation system**, or as **an intermediate format**. In the latter role, for example, it is sometimes used as part of a pipeline for translating `DocBook` and `other XML-based formats` to `PDF`. The typesetting system offers programmable desktop publishing features and extensive facilities for automating most aspects of typesetting and desktop publishing, including **numbering and cross-referencing of tables and figures, chapter and section headings, graphics, page layout, indexing and bibliographies**.

## Attention:exclamation:	

> Before starting, it is important to note that:

> $ Markdown $ is rendered as `HTML` and its syntax conflicts with $ LaTeX $, which affects the effect of the article. E.g. braces should be avoided repeatedly, spaces should be added.

## Formula Insertion

- Formulas are divided into inline formulas and formula blocks, the former is embedded in a line, and the latter is a separate line.
